Create an EC2 Instance with the resource name mario_servers.

Use the following specifications:
AMI: Use variable called ami.

Tags: Create a tag with key Name and value set to the variable called name.

Instance_type: Use a conditional expression so that - If the instance is created with a tag Name = "tiny", it should use the variable called small else the variable called large.

We will supply the variable called name using the -var command line flag.

resource "aws_instance" "mario_servers" {
     ami = var.ami
     instance_type = var.name == "tiny" ? var.small : var.large
     tags = {
          Name = var.name
     }
